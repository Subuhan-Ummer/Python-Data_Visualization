# Python-Data_Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for data visualization exercises using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Overview

The project includes solutions to three exercises:

1. **Line Plot for Population Trends**  
   Visualizes the population growth of four cities over time using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

2. **Scatter Plot for Study Hours vs Test Scores**  
   Demonstrates the relationship between hours studied and test scores using `seaborn`.

3. **Bar Chart for Monthly Sales**  
   Represents total sales for each month of the year using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Additionally, this repository includes a PDF containing screenshots of the generated visualizations.
